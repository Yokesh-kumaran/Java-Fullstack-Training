E-Commerce application in angular:
    Hosted the angular application in github.
    In products page, if i click add to cart button,the add to cart button gets invisible bacause of the count
    gets increased in cart and (- & +) button gets visible where we can increase and decrease the product count.
    This process also gets reflect in the cart page.
    Used lottieanimations to show if the cart is empty.
