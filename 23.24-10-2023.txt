Worked with core concepts in java like,

*Object.
    In java, everything is object that's why we are naming it as Object Oriented Programming Language.

*Class.
    Class is a blueprint.

*Method.
    We can create it once and can be accessed multiple times.

*MethodOverloading.
    In polymorphism, in compile time polymorphism, MethodOverloading is used where we can have multiple 
    methods but with different parameters and return type.

*Constructor.
    Same name as class name.

*Interface.
    Interface is like a design in which we can't have implemented methods and we can also handle multiple
    inheritance here.

*Abstract.
    Abstract can have both implemented and unimplemented methods.Hiding the implemented details.

*Encapsulation.
    Binding the date is known as Encapsulation.Here we will be using getters and setters to access and 
    modify the contents which is in private scope.

*Casting.
    Two types of casting is,
    1.Upcasting - Child to Parent
    2.DownCasting - Parent to Child

*Thread.
    By extending thread in the class, we can use the methods by starting the thread object.

*Date.
    By Date class we can access the date and by using SimpleDateFormatter class we can format the date
    by creating the object for date.

*Exception handling.
    We can handle the exception by using the,
    1.Try
    2.Catch block

*Collection
    We use Collection to overcome the Array, Did arrayList for today.
