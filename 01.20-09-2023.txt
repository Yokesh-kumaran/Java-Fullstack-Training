1.Basic Built and connection with server
    There will be:
        Developers: Who develops the server.
        Build and deployment: After designing,the built will be done and then after testing deployment will be done.
        Server: Which gives access to the clients.
        Database: The server responds to the client's request by getting the datum from database.
        User: Who acts as a client to get information from server.
        Load balancer: If one server fails then it gives access to the other server.
        Log: Which stores the data in the middle.
        Metric: Which evaluates the users.
        Sample apps: Redbus, Flipkart, Amazon etc...

2.DNS
    Which gives the IP address for the given name, if we have the IP address, we can directly access the server.

3.TCP(Transmission Control Protocol)
    In this client will send the synchronization message to the server and server sends the acknowledge message to the client.If the date missed anywhere the process will be stoped.

4.UDP(User Datagram Protocol)
    In the server won't mind to send the acknowledge message it sends the message wisely.

5.API(Application Progamming Interface)
