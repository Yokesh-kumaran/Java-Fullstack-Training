Struts:
=======
Struts is used to create a web applications based on servlet and JSP. 
Struts depend on the MVC (Model View Controller) framework. 
Struts application is a genuine web application. Struts are thoroughly 
useful in building J2EE (Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition) applications because struts takes advantage of J2EE design patterns. Struts follows these J2EE design patterns including MVC.
 
In struts, the composite view manages the layout of its sub-views and 
can implement a template, making persistent look and feel easier to achieve 
and customize across the entire application. A composite view is made up by using 
other reusable sub views such that a small change happens in a sub-view is automatically 
updated in every composite view.
 
Struts consists of a set of own custom tag libraries. Struts are based on
MVC framework which is pattern oriented and includes JSP custom tag libraries. 
Struts also supports utility classes.
